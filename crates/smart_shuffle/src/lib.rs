//! Smart Shuffle for Sustain — a local, deterministic,
//! seed-conditioned *perceptual transition scorer*.
//!
//! Given the track playing now, Smart Shuffle chooses a next track
//! from the library that feels like a *continuation* of it — the same
//! mood, flow, and thread the listener is already inside. It is a
//! **sequencer**, not a recommender: every score is a function of the
//! *pair* (X, Y), never of the candidate Y in isolation. In a
//! hand-curated library every track is already liked, so there is
//! nothing to learn about whether the user likes Y; what remains is
//! the largely-objective, perceptual question of whether Y *follows* X
//! well.
//!
//! ## No learning, by design
//!
//! There is no model and no training. Continuation is scored by a
//! fixed, interpretable, hand-weighted perceptual metric over track
//! pairs. This is deliberate: the only behavioural labels available
//! (play/skip counts, album order, playlist adjacency) are *dishonest*
//! for this task — they measure track-level engagement or teach
//! "stay on the album," the inverse of a library-wide shuffle. Fixed
//! weights here do not mean "there is nothing to learn"; they mean
//! "we refuse to learn from dishonest labels." The architecture
//! reserves a seam to learn later from *explicit* user transition
//! feedback — the one label source that actually scores the pair —
//! but builds no learning machinery now.
//!
//! ## Shape
//!
//! * [`index`] — the prepared, library-dependent state ([`SmartShuffleIndex`]):
//!   genre-token IDF (and, later, robust normalization statistics).
//!   Rebuilt on a cadence; persisted as an opaque, schema-versioned
//!   blob. *Not* a fitted model.
//! * [`similarity`] — the per-feature, seed-conditioned similarity
//!   functions, each masked (`None`) when its feature is absent.
//! * [`affinity`] — the masked weighted sum with the coverage
//!   correction for thin evidence.
//! * [`picker`] — the four-term pipeline (guards → affinity → priors →
//!   penalties), bounded-pool temperature sampling, and the debug log.
//!
//! This crate has no Sustain-runtime dependency: it borrows `&[Track]`
//! slices and returns plain data. The runtime (`sustain_app_runtime`)
//! schedules the index rebuild, persists the blob, and feeds pick
//! context to [`pick_next_track`].
